<p>The latest version of gfxCardStatus has been released! It now has a list of processes that are using the NVIDIA card, if that's the active GPU. Now it's easier than ever to tell exactly what's the culprit of your shortened battery life.</p>
<p>As usual, just hit "Check for Updates" from the menu bar icon if you've got v1.2 or above already, or go download it at <a href="http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus/">http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus/</a></p>
