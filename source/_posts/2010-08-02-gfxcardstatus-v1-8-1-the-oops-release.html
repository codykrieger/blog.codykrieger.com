<p>What?! Another release already?! You bet. I made a rather stupid mistake that made gfxCardStatus crash upon building the dependency list at times. This update fixes the issue.</p>
<p>Please update at your leisure by hitting 'Check for updates' in the
  menu, or downloading it manually from my website. Release notes are <a
    href="http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus/releasenotes/1.8.1.html">available
    here</a>.
