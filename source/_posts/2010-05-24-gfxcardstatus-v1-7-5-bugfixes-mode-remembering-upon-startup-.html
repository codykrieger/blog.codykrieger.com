<p>You may have noticed v1.7.5 has been released! Included are some bugfixes (namely the one where the GPU would sometimes switch back to the 330M after all dependent apps had quit while on Intel Only mode), and the ability to have it recall the last mode you used before quitting on startup. A full list of changes is <a href="http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus/changelog">available here</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven't already downloaded it, you can <a href="http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus/">go get it here</a>!</p>
