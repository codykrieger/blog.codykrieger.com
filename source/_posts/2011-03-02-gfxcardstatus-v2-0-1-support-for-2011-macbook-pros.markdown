I'm excited to announce that 2011 MacBook Pros have joined the ranks of 
systems that are compatible with gfxCardStatus!

As usual, just hit Check for Updates or download manually from 
[the gfxCardStatus website](http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus). Also, 
take a look at the [release notes](http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus/releasenotes/2.0.1.html) 
for some important information.

Comments, suggestions and general feedback are always welcome in the comments 
or via email (cody [at] codykrieger [dot] com).

What are you waiting for? Go get it!
