<p>I just got my hands on a brand new 17" MacBook Pro with the 2.66GHz Intel Core i7 in it, and the NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M graphics card. The thing is screaming fast! I was a bit annoyed by the fact that you couldn't easily view which GPU was in use...but now, there's an app for that! Specifically, gfxCardStatus. It's of my own creation. You can download it here: <a href="http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus.app.zip">http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus</a></p>
<p><a href="http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus.app.zip"></a>gfxCardStatus is a menu bar application that automatically updates when your display configuration changes (e.g. plugging in an external display, etc.). The "i" icon signifies that the Intel HD Graphics are in use, and the "n" signifies that the NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M is in use.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Please note that this app will not work with any generations of the MacBook Pro prior to the most recent model with the i5s and i7s that have the 330M.</span>&nbsp;Any dual-GPU MacBook Pro is supported (late 2008 to current generation).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Until I set up a permanent webpage for gfxCardStatus, discussion of it lives in this MacRumors Forums thread: </span><a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=901521&amp;page=5#122"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=901521&amp;page=5#122</span></a> gfxCardStatus' official homepage: <a href="http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus/">http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus/</a></p>
