<p>Ladies and gentlemen!  gfxCardStatus v2.0 has been officially released! Please <a href="http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus/releasenotes/2.0.html">check out the release notes</a> for the full list of changes (there are <em>a lot</em>). The biggest thing to note is that 9400M/9600M GT users now have power source-based switching! A host of bugfixes were put in place, and I'm also proud to announce that gfxCardStatus is now localized in <strong><em>11 languages</em></strong> (including English)! Thanks to everyone who has sent in localizations! If you would like to translate gfxCardStatus into another language, get in touch with me (cody [at] codykrieger [dot] com).</p>
<p>Hit "Check for Updates" or go download it manually from the gfxCardStatus website! <a href="http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus">http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus</a></p>
