<p>That's right! v1.7 has been released! Full support for indicating status of 9400M/9600M GT systems (as well as the switching that worked before) is built in to v1.7.</p>
<p>The rest of the users on i5/i7 systems will see three new things: Intel Only mode, NVIDIA Only mode, and Dynamic Switching mode. The first two are obvious, and the latter hands dynamic switching control back to OS X.  I have also completely eliminated the delay associated with opening the menu bar item when the dependent process list was being generated, while the 330M was the active GPU. Cool, huh?!</p>
<p><a href="http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus/">Go get it</a>!  Let me know if you run into any issues. I'm aware of the bug where it occasionally switches back to the 330M when you're on Intel Only mode and you quit all apps that would normally use the 330M. This will be fixed in a maintenance release in the future.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>
