<p>You heard right! I have open-sourced the code for gfxCardStatus. It can be found on GitHub at <a href="http://github.com/codykrieger/gfxCardStatus">http://github.com/codykrieger/gfxCardStatus</a>. Create a fork, go nuts, and feel free to send the comments and suggestions my way!</p>
<p>v1.7 is almost upon us, which will support toggling automatic switching between GPUs, or manually locking the machine on one or the other GPU. Cheers!</p>
<p>Oh, and I made <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/08/macbook-pros-with-nvidia-geforce-gt-330m-graphics-get-discrete-s/">Engadget</a> and <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/3709/gfxcardstatus-brings-2010-macbook-pro-gpu-switching">AnandTech</a>, as well as various other sweet tech news sites&nbsp;today. :)</p>
