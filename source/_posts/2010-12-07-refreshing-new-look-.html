<p>As you may have noticed, <a href="http://codykrieger.com">my website just got a major overhaul</a>.  It's much cleaner and easier on the eyes than it once was. <strong>It even looks great in lynx</strong>.  Please let me know if anyone has any issues with broken links or missing content. General feedback is also welcome at cody [at] codykrieger [dot] com, or via the comments. :)  Thanks!</p>

<p>P.S. - The next gfxCardStatus v2.0 beta will be out in the next couple days. Follow me <a href="http://twitter.com/codykrieger">on Twitter (@codykrieger)</a> to see the news when it breaks!</p>
