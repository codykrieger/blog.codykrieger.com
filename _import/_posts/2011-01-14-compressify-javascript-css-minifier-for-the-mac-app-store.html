title: Compressify - JavaScript/CSS Minifier for the Mac App Store
published: true
---
<p>My newest endeavor into OS X development! Just submitted to the Mac App Store today, pending review.</p>
<p>Super simple, no-frills JavaScript and CSS minification and obfuscation. That's Compressify! Check out its dedicated page on my website here: <a href="http://codykrieger.com/compressify">http://codykrieger.com/compressify</a></p>
<p>If you're willing to write an honest review, hit me up via email (cody [at] codykrieger [dot] com), and I'll hook you up with a review copy once Compressify is released!</p>
<p>Until next time, ladies and gents!</p>
