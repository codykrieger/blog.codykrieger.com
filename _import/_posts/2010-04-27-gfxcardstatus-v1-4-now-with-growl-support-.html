<p>Exactly as the title implies, I have added Growl support to v1.4 of <a href="http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus/">gfxCardStatus</a>! If you've got v1.2 or above, you can just hit "Check for Updates" in the menu, and you're all set.</p>
<p>Drop a comment or an email if you've got any problems!</p>
<p>ck :)</p>
