title: gfxCardStatus and 2009 MacBook Pros with NVIDIA 9400/9600 GPUs
published: true

<p>Many users have reported that gfxCardStatus works <em><strong>even on the 2009 MacBook Pros</strong></em>! I don't have one to test with, but I can only assume that this is indeed the case. It wil continually show the "n," as the detection for which GPU is in use isn't built in yet, but switching works, <strong><em>without logging out</em></strong>. I'll build the detection into a future version, hopefully sooner rather than later! I envision an icon change: "d" for discrete, and "i" for integrated. This will provide greater consistency across all platforms.</p>
